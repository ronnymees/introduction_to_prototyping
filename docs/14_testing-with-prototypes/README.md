# Testing with prototypes

In Project Experience you will be taking the following steps:
* Forming a concept idea
* Creating a architecture document
* Make a prototype
* Produce a first product

:::tip ðŸ’¡Note
When testing you need to be aware that your product can suffer from external influences like noise, light, sun, temperature, location, network, ...
:::

## Concept idea

When a concept idea is made it is not unusual to make af few prototypes in for instance paper, cardboard or foam to test basic functionality, shape, ergonomics, ...

## Architecture document

When building a architecture you need to make sure that every part of that architecture works properly and is reliable.
Therefore each part of that architecture needs to be tested by building a prototype and perform the necessary tests to make sure function and reliability is guaranteed.

If problems occure one needs to adjust, rebuild a new prototype until all is good.

## Prototype of the product

Once the seperate parts are checked, the complete architecture needs to be tested by building a complete prototype and again test it on function and reliablility.

If problems occure one needs to adjust. It's even posible that you need to go back to the architecture fase and redo some parts there.

## Final product

Now you should make the product itself and again perform test, but this time this should be user test that look at the functionality, durability, user friendlyness, ...
