# Tools & Workspace

## Workspace

In our prototyping lab we made several working area's, let's discuss some ground rules for each of these erea's.

### Work islands 

These are working tables where students can prototype with paper and cardboard, work on CAD models and electronics. It is strictly forbidden to perform dust creating actions or use chemicals in this erea.

At the end of the lesson this erea is cleaned and waste is disposed of in the right disposal container. Usable peaces are placed back in the warehouse.

### Manual labor

This is the area where you can work on foam prototypes, drill holes and use the sanding belt. It is important to contain and collect dust that is generated from sanding by using some form of dust-collection system.

At the end of the lesson this erea is cleaned (use the vacume cleaner for dust and not a brush) and waste is disposed of in the right disposal container. Usable peaces are placed back in the warehouse.


### 3D printing

Here you will find the 3D printers.

At the end of the lesson this erea is cleaned and waste is disposed of in the right disposal container. Usable peaces are placed back in the warehouse.

## Tools

In the prototyping lab you will be using both hand tools and powertools. Please keep in mind the **health and safety** rules as described previously.

### Hand tools

All hand tools are stored in cabinets, students are free to take these tools during the practicum but at the end of the lessons all tools are placed back in the cabinet in good condition. If anything happens to a tool, always warn the teacher about this.

As for hand tools you mainly will be using:
* Steel rule
* Venier caliper
* Hand saw
* Utility knife
* Rasp
* Files
* Pliers
* Sandpaper
* Screwdriver
* Soldering iron

### Power tools

The powertools have a specific place in the prototyping lab and always require you to wear protective measures and keep the healt and safety rules in mind.
Don't use these tools without a proper instruction from the teacher.

* Drill press
* Sanding belt
