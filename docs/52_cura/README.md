# Cura

We will be using Ultimaker Cura to slice our models for 3D printing.

You can download the latest version on [Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/nl/software/ultimaker-cura/#downloads).

Start the downloaded install `.exe` file and follow the instructions. You can choose witch components you want installed.

When the installation is finished, you can start Cura. A welcome setup will be shown where you must add at least one 3D printer. Just add both the Ender 3 S1 and Ender 3 S1 Plus.
