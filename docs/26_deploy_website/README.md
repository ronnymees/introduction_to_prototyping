You've spent hours building your website and now it needs to be posted publicly.
First and foremost you need a Web Host for this.

## Find a suitable Web Host

### Shared Web Hosts

Your first option is to use one of the popular hosting platforms such as Combell, One, Neostrada and Argeweb. The actual server where your website is stored is owned by the hosting service and is shared with other websites.

Shared hosting is an affordable option, but it also has drawbacks such as slow page load times or downtime. Some platforms also limit RAM and CPU usage, which can lead to performance issues for your website.

### Managed Web Hosts

Managed hosting, in short, means that the hosting company such as Nucleus or Hostnet handles the setup, administration and maintenance of the servers.

Managed hosting costs a little more than shared hosting, but the investment always pays off in terms of better performance, security, support, and improved workload.

### DIY Host

Another option is to take full responsibility for configuring, updating, and maintaining your website servers.

It may sound like a good deal because you don't have to pay a managed hosting provider. But it is a lot of work and requires a great deal of technical expertise.

If you don't have the resources to manage regular backups, security scans, and other maintenance, DIY hosting isn't for you.

## Upload files and test

Now that you have a Web Host you can upload your files and folder structure.

Before you publish the website effectively, it is wise to test the website thoroughly in a small group or in preview mode.

## Time to publish

The moment of truth, you can finally share the website with the world.
You can now buy your domain name, configure the web host and then publish.

Everyone can now consult your website, but that does not mean that it is immediately findable.
It is now a matter of registering your website with search engines.

To submit your website to Google, use [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome?utm_source=about-page), and verify ownership of the website.

1. Go to Google Search Console and log in with your google account (if you are not already logged in via Google Chrome).
2. Now add your domain name
3. To prove ownership of this domain, simply use the DNS TXT record.

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

The core of SEO is figuring out what terms people are likely to enter into a search engine to find your site and then using those terms in the right places on your site to increase the likelihood that search engines will display a link to your site in their Results.

To determine who comes first in search results, search engines don't just look at what's on your site. They also look at how many sites link to you (and how relevant those links are). For this reason, SEO is often split into two areas: on-page techniques and off-page techniques.

### On page techniques

These are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their 'rating' in search engines.
The most important part of this is looking at keywords that people are likely to enter into a search engine to find your site, and then include them in the text and HTML code for your site to help the search engines discover that your site has it. topics covered.

Search engines rely very heavily on the text contained in your pages, so it is important that the correct search terms are in the text. There are seven essential places for this where this can be done.

### Off page techniques

Getting other sites to link to your site is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines determine the importance of your page by looking at how many other websites link to your page. They are particularly interested in sites whose content is related to yours. Search engines also look at the words between the opening `<a>` tag and closing `</a>` tag in the link. If the text in the link contains information instead of 'click here' that is more relevant.

### The seven places of keywords on a page

1. Page title

     The title in the header of the browser window
2. URL or web address

     The name of a URL can contain important keywords.
3. Headers

     You can also process keywords in a title
4. Text

     If you repeat keywords at least 2 to 3 times in your text, this will also be picked up, but do not overdo it with these repetitions.
5. Link text

     The text you use with a link can also contain keywords.
6. Alt text with an image

     Provide an accurate description of an image in the alt text, so a search engine will use your images when searching.
7. The page description

     In the meta data you can also use the description of the page with certain keywords.
