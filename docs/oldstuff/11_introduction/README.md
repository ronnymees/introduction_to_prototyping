# Introduction

Behind every successful product design is a story of numerous refinements and much hard work. The fact is that the transformation of an idea into a real product takes a great deal of work, involving more than simply creating pictures and schematics on the computer. Product design is a complex activity, which involves working with other people and disciplines, coming up with creative and useful ideas (that hopefully are also sustainable), and slugging through all the iterations of making something work and look good at the same time. One method that has always been used by designers, and continues to be embraced, is that of **physical prototyping**.

:::tip üìÑNote
The terms physical prototype and model can be used interchangeably to describe a preliminary representation of a product, service, or system.

In recent years the use of the word ‚Äúprototype‚Äù has become favored as it is more encompassing. A wide range of physical prototypes is used throughout the design process to simulate different aspects of a product before it is produced:
* Appearance
* Ergonomics
* Functionality

## Appearance

The main goal of a prototype of **the shell of a product** is to see if the products looks like intended in the concept idea and **is appealing enough** for the general public. Generaly you start off with rough and quick prototypes for the overal shape of your product and then refine to details with other prototypes.

For instance if you would like to develop a new gaming console, you could make the general shape out of cardboard. Once the team is in agreement of that shape you can start looking at the details and use foam or 3D printing for that. Always ask the opinion of others in this matter.

:::tip üìéNote
The look and feel of a product always comes first. If you make a product that is very good but not attractive or pleasant in use it won't sell very well.

## Ergonomics

The shape of your product is one thing but if it is a product that needs to interact physicaly with a human, than you also need to take **the ergonomics of your product** in concideration. Here you need to make a prototype that represents the shape but also the estimated weight of your product. Again you can use foam of 3D printing for the shape and add material inside for the weight. Again you need to involve as many people as possible to improve your ergonomics.

:::tip üìéNote
Together with the look and feel goes the ergonomics of a product when it wil be used by humans. A very attractive game controller that forces your fingers in impossible positions won't do well on the market.

## Functionality

For the functionality we need to make a difference between the mechanical functions and the electronics.

### Mechanical

When we talk about mechanical functionality we focus on **moving parts and clamping/clicking connections**.
For instance a gas pedal of a racing simulator or the way a devices is attached to a frame or other parts, like for instance modular lighting features.

Here we need to make prototypes that can simulate that movement or attachement without the need of other functionality. Except if the movement is driven by for example a servo, you need to make sure the servo had enough force to do so.

### Electronics

If electronics are involved then you need to make a **architecture document**, determen what components will be uses, lookup there **datasheets** and then make a first electronic circuit. Next you build a prototype electronic circuit with a breadboard to verify all facets of your architecture. You do this by **describing all tests neccesary to measure and verify** the electronical functionality and reliability.
