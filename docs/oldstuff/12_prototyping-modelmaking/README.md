# Prototyping & Modelmaking

**Prototyping** and **modelmaking**, although inherently related terms, actually refer to different activities. Prototyping is a design method that uses physical prototypes to **study and test** how a new product will be used, and how it will look and be manufactured. Modelmaking, on the other hand, is the step-by-step method of producing the prototype.


## Prototyping

Prototyping is a key **problem-solving activity** in product design. It starts right from the beginning of a project and continues right into production. Given the complexity of product development, **it is critical to take as much of the guesswork out of the design process** as possible, and prevent surprises from showing up later in a project. It is much less expensive to solve problems early in a project than later, when tooling may have been started and sales commitments made. Prototypes evolve along with the design process; simple prototypes serve as initial three-dimensional sketches and are then replaced by iterations of successively more refined versions.

The more complicated the product, the more disciplines will be involved, and the more prototypes typically needed. Physical prototypes enable teamwork and
collaboration, since they serve to gather team members around for discussion and reflection. The prototypes oblige the team to deal with real issues, which are more easily ignored in memos and verbal discussions alone. Prototypes are also used to **study and compare alternative approaches**. This includes testing everything from technical requirements of construction to usability.

The electronics we develop and also cycle trough prototypes for refinement tent to go hand in hand with physical designs of mechanical parts, like for instance a body of a game controller.

### Physical and Digital Prototypes

Product designers need to have competency in several skills, including sketching, CAD, and modelmaking. These are all critical tools and should be used effectively and not exclusively. A workflow that shifts back and forth between different skills expands the creative possibilities and is more balanced.

Computer technology has completely changed the way in which products are conceived and developed. Virtual computer models allow us to visualize
the product, see how parts fit together, calculate the weight, and carry out performance simulations along the way.

Physical prototypes, on the other hand, answer questions that are hard or impossible to address on the computer alone. These questions usually have to do with the qualitative human aspects. Whereas computer simulation can be used to verify many technical requirements, physical prototypes can be placed into real environments and have tangible qualities, such as weight, size, and texture, that can be experienced at first hand. Experienced designers build a great many physical prototypes along with virtual computer models. It is not a question of physical versus digital, but rather a matter of how
the two approaches complement each other best.

## Modelmaking

The rich design tradition of developing sensitivity to materials, manufacturing, and workmanship is based on the idea of learning by doing, which goes back to the beginning of industrial design. We actually **learn** different things **from making** the prototype (modelmaking) than we do from using the prototype (prototyping). Material properties do not have any real connection to the world we live in unless we first inform our senses in a hands-on way. By experiencing real materials and processes, the material qualities gain meaning. The sensibility and experience attained from this process form the basis for intuition and are therefore essential for conceptualization.

### Building by Hand and Using Computers

All physical prototypes used to be built manually by hand. Nowadays new digital technologies enable 3D computer files to be output to automated computer-controlled prototyping machines. This may create the impression that prototypes no longer need to be made by hand at all, but that would be far from the truth. Early ideas are actually explored faster by hand. What starts as sketches and quick handmade models gradually migrates to the computer and eventually from there to rapid prototyping or CNC machining.

## Workflow

**1. Preperations**

Once we have our concept idea the team will start making preperations for prototyping:
* Determen the way to make a low-cost prototype of the shape and details.
* Determen the way to make a low-cost prototype to test functionality.
* Create a architecture document for the electronics, determen each component and consult the datasheets.
* Create the electronic schematic and record all tests necessary to ensure the functionality and reliability of the system.

**2. Prototyping**

Create all prototypes and for the electronics use a breadboard.

**3. Adjust and repeat**

Adjust all that can be improved or is faulty and repeat this proces until all requirements are met.

**4. Make a 3D model of your product**

Now you are ready to make a 3D model of your design and start making more advanced prototypes, like a body that is 3D printed and a PCB.
Again evaluation will take place and if needed adjustments are made. Until you have a product that is ready for production.
