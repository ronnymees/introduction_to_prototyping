# Guidelines

Some practical advice in your first steps of prototyping:

1. Don't make it if you can buy it

    So if you need standard parts in your prototype, like brackets or fasteners, then you don't make this yourselfs but you buy it. It is often the fastest and cheapest way to get those parts.

2. Cheap and fast

    Think about what you want to test, then make a prototype that is suited for that by using the cheapest materials and easiest tooling for that.
